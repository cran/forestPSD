Description: Analysis of forest population structure and quantitative dynamics is the research and evaluation of the composition, distribution, age structure and changes in quantity over time of various populations in the forest. By deeply understanding these characteristics of forest populations, scientific basis can be provided for the management, protection and sustainable utilization of forest resources. This R package conducts a systematic analysis of forest population structure and quantitative dynamics through analyzing age structure, compiling life tables, population quantitative dynamic change indices and time series models, in order to provide support for forest population protection and sustainable management.
